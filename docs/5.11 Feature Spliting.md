### **1. Extracting Title from the Name Column**

```python
df['Title'] = df['Name'].str.split(', ', expand=True)[1].str.split('.', expand=True)[0]
```

- **Splits `Name` by `,` (comma + space)** and selects the second part (`expand=True` creates a DataFrame).
- **Splits again by `.` (dot)** to extract the **Title** (e.g., "Mr", "Miss", "Dr").
- Stores the extracted title in a new column: `df['Title']`.

---

### **2. Viewing Extracted Titles Alongside Names**

```python
df[['Title', 'Name']]
```

- Displays the `Title` alongside `Name` to **verify the extraction**.

---

### **3. Analyzing Survival Rate by Title**

```python
(df.groupby('Title').mean()['Survived']).sort_values(ascending=False)
```

- Groups data by `Title` and calculates the **average survival rate** for each title.
- Sorts the survival rates in **descending order**.
- Helps **identify which titles had higher survival chances** (e.g., "Miss" & "Mrs" might have higher survival rates due to Titanic's "women and children first" policy).

---

### **4. Creating a Binary Feature: `Is_Married`**

```python
df['Is_Married'] = 0
df['Is_Married'].loc[df['Title'] == 'Mrs'] = 1
```

- Initializes a new column `Is_Married` with **0** (default: unmarried).
- Updates `Is_Married` to **1** for passengers with the title **"Mrs"** (assumed to be married women).

---

### **5. Viewing the `Is_Married` Column**

```python
df['Is_Married']
```

- Displays the newly created **binary marital status** column.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

âœ” **Feature Extraction**: Extracted `Title` from `Name` to create a new categorical feature.  
âœ” **Feature Engineering**: Created `Is_Married`, which could improve model accuracy by differentiating marital status.  
âœ” **Survival Analysis**: Checked survival rates by `Title` to find meaningful patterns.

Would you like to encode the `Title` feature for model training? ðŸš€
