**Tags:**   [[Data Preprocessing]]  [[Feature Engineering]]
### **1. Importing Libraries**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```
- **Explanation**: You import the necessary libraries:
  - `numpy` (`np`) for numerical operations.
  - `pandas` (`pd`) for data manipulation and analysis.

---

### **2. Loading Data**
```python
date = pd.read_csv('orders.csv')
time = pd.read_csv('messages.csv')
```
- **Explanation**: You load two CSV files (`orders.csv` and `messages.csv`) into pandas DataFrames named `date` and `time`.

---

### **3. Inspecting Data**
```python
date.head()
time.head()
date.info()
time.info()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `head()` displays the first 5 rows of each DataFrame.
  - `info()` provides a summary of the DataFrame, including column names, data types, and non-null counts.

---

### **4. Converting to Datetime**
```python
date['date'] = pd.to_datetime(date['date'])
date.info()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `date` column in the `date` DataFrame is converted to a `datetime` datatype using `pd.to_datetime()`.
  - This allows for easy extraction of date components (year, month, day, etc.).

---

### **5. Extracting Date Components**
#### **a. Extracting Year**
```python
date['date_year'] = date['date'].dt.year
date.sample(5)
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `year` component is extracted from the `date` column and stored in a new column `date_year`.
  - `sample(5)` randomly samples 5 rows from the DataFrame.

#### **b. Extracting Month**
```python
date['date_month_no'] = date['date'].dt.month
date.head()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `month` component (as a number, e.g., 1 for January) is extracted and stored in `date_month_no`.

```python
date['date_month_name'] = date['date'].dt.month_name()
date.head()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `month` component (as a name, e.g., "January") is extracted and stored in `date_month_name`.

#### **c. Extracting Day**
```python
date['date_day'] = date['date'].dt.day
date.head()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `day` component (day of the month) is extracted and stored in `date_day`.

#### **d. Extracting Day of Week**
```python
date['date_dow'] = date['date'].dt.dayofweek
date.head()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `dayofweek` component (day of the week as a number, where Monday = 0 and Sunday = 6) is extracted and stored in `date_dow`.

```python
date['date_dow_name'] = date['date'].dt.day_name()
date.drop(columns=['product_id', 'city_id', 'orders']).head()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `day_name()` method extracts the day of the week as a name (e.g., "Monday") and stores it in `date_dow_name`.
  - Unnecessary columns (`product_id`, `city_id`, `orders`) are dropped for cleaner output.

#### **e. Checking for Weekend**
```python
date['date_is_weekend'] = np.where(date['date_dow_name'].isin(['Sunday', 'Saturday']), 1, 0)
date.drop(columns=['product_id', 'city_id', 'orders']).head()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - A new column `date_is_weekend` is created, where `1` indicates a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) and `0` indicates a weekday.

#### **f. Extracting Week of the Year**
```python
date['date_week'] = date['date'].dt.isocalendar().week
date.drop(columns=['product_id', 'city_id', 'orders']).head()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `week` component (week number of the year) is extracted and stored in `date_week`.

#### **g. Extracting Quarter**
```python
date['quarter'] = date['date'].dt.quarter
date.drop(columns=['product_id', 'city_id', 'orders']).head()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `quarter` component (1 to 4) is extracted and stored in `quarter`.

#### **h. Extracting Semester**
```python
date['semester'] = np.where(date['quarter'].isin([1, 2]), 1, 2)
date.drop(columns=['product_id', 'city_id', 'orders']).head()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - A new column `semester` is created, where `1` represents the first half of the year (quarters 1 and 2) and `2` represents the second half (quarters 3 and 4).

---

### **6. Calculating Date Differences**
```python
import datetime
today = datetime.datetime.today()
today - date['date']
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The difference between the current date (`today`) and the dates in the `date` column is calculated, resulting in a `timedelta` object.

```python
(today - date['date']).dt.days
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The difference in days is extracted from the `timedelta` object.

```python
# Months passed
np.round((today - date['date']) / np.timedelta64(1, 'M'), 0)
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The difference in months is calculated by dividing the `timedelta` by `np.timedelta64(1, 'M')` (1 month in nanoseconds) and rounding to the nearest integer.

---

### **7. Working with Time Data**
```python
time.info()
time['date'] = pd.to_datetime(time['date'])
time.info()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `date` column in the `time` DataFrame is converted to a `datetime` datatype.

#### **a. Extracting Time Components**
```python
time['hour'] = time['date'].dt.hour
time['min'] = time['date'].dt.minute
time['sec'] = time['date'].dt.second
time.head()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `hour`, `minute`, and `second` components are extracted and stored in new columns.

```python
time['time'] = time['date'].dt.time
time.head()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `time` component (without the date) is extracted and stored in a new column `time`.

#### **b. Calculating Time Differences**
```python
today - time['date']
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The difference between the current datetime (`today`) and the datetimes in the `time` column is calculated.

```python
# In seconds
(today - time['date']) / np.timedelta64(1, 's')
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The difference is converted to seconds.

```python
# In minutes
(today - time['date']) / np.timedelta64(1, 'm')
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The difference is converted to minutes.

```python
# In hours
(today - time['date']) / np.timedelta64(1, 'h')
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The difference is converted to hours.

### **Summary**
- The code demonstrates how to:
  1. Load and inspect data.
  2. Convert columns to `datetime` datatype.
  3. Extract various date and time components.
  4. Perform calculations with dates and times (e.g., differences, rounding).
- This is a comprehensive example of working with dates and times in pandas, which is essential for time-series analysis and data manipulation.
