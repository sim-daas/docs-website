### **Code Breakdown and Explanation**

#### 1. **Split Data into Training and Test Sets**
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=2)
```
- **Purpose**: Splits the dataset (`X` and `y`) into training and test sets.
  - `test_size=0.2`: 20% of the data is used for testing, and 80% is used for training.
  - `random_state=2`: Ensures reproducibility by fixing the random seed.
- **Output**:
  - `X_train`: Features for training.
  - `X_test`: Features for testing.
  - `y_train`: Target variable for training.
  - `y_test`: Target variable for testing.

---

#### 2. **Create SimpleImputer Objects**
```python
imputer1 = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
imputer2 = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
```
- **Purpose**: Creates two `SimpleImputer` objects to handle missing values in different columns.
  - `imputer1`: Replaces missing values in the `Age` column with the **median**.
  - `imputer2`: Replaces missing values in the `Fare` column with the **mean**.
- **Parameters**:
  - `strategy='median'`: Uses the median of the column for imputation.
  - `strategy='mean'`: Uses the mean of the column for imputation.

---

#### 3. **Create a ColumnTransformer**
```python
trf = ColumnTransformer([
    ('imputer1', imputer1, ['Age']),
    ('imputer2', imputer2, ['Fare'])
], remainder='passthrough')
```
- **Purpose**: Combines multiple imputation strategies into a single transformer.
  - Applies `imputer1` to the `Age` column.
  - Applies `imputer2` to the `Fare` column.
  - `remainder='passthrough'`: Ensures that columns not explicitly transformed are passed through without changes.
- **Output**: A `ColumnTransformer` object (`trf`).

---

#### 4. **Fit the ColumnTransformer on Training Data**
```python
trf.fit(X_train)
```
- **Purpose**: Fits the `ColumnTransformer` on the training data (`X_train`).
  - Computes the necessary statistics (e.g., median for `Age`, mean for `Fare`) for imputation.
- **Output**: The fitted `ColumnTransformer` object.

---

#### 5. **Check Imputation Statistics**
```python
trf.named_transformers_['imputer1'].statistics_
# Output: array([28.75])

trf.named_transformers_['imputer2'].statistics_
# Output: array([32.61759689])
```
- **Purpose**: Retrieves the statistics (median and mean) used for imputation.
  - `imputer1` uses the median value `28.75` for the `Age` column.
  - `imputer2` uses the mean value `32.61759689` for the `Fare` column.
- **Output**: Arrays containing the computed statistics.

---

#### 6. **Transform Training and Test Data**
```python
X_train = trf.transform(X_train)
X_test = trf.transform(X_test)
```
- **Purpose**: Applies the fitted `ColumnTransformer` to the training and test datasets.
  - Replaces missing values in the `Age` and `Fare` columns with the computed statistics.
- **Output**: Transformed versions of `X_train` and `X_test`.

---

#### 7. **Display Transformed Training Data**
```python
X_train
```
- **Purpose**: Displays the transformed training data after imputation.
- **Output**: A NumPy array or DataFrame (depending on the input) with missing values replaced.

### **Full Code with Comments**
```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

# Split the dataset into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=2)

# Create SimpleImputer objects for different columns
imputer1 = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')  # For 'Age' column
imputer2 = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')    # For 'Fare' column

# Create a ColumnTransformer to apply imputers to specific columns
trf = ColumnTransformer([
    ('imputer1', imputer1, ['Age']),  # Apply imputer1 to 'Age'
    ('imputer2', imputer2, ['Fare'])  # Apply imputer2 to 'Fare'
], remainder='passthrough')  # Pass through other columns unchanged

# Fit the ColumnTransformer on the training data
trf.fit(X_train)

# Check the statistics used for imputation
print(trf.named_transformers_['imputer1'].statistics_)  # Output: [28.75]
print(trf.named_transformers_['imputer2'].statistics_)  # Output: [32.61759689]

# Transform the training and test data
X_train = trf.transform(X_train)
X_test = trf.transform(X_test)

# Display the transformed training data
print(X_train)
```

### **Key Notes**
1. **Imputation Strategy**:
   - Using `strategy='median'` is robust to outliers, making it suitable for skewed data (e.g., `Age`).
   - Using `strategy='mean'` is appropriate for normally distributed data (e.g., `Fare`).

2. **ColumnTransformer**:
   - Enables you to apply different transformations to different columns in a dataset.
   - The `remainder='passthrough'` argument ensures that columns not explicitly transformed are included in the output.

3. **Training and Test Data**:
   - Always fit the transformer on the training data (`X_train`) and then apply it to both the training and test data (`X_test`).
   - This ensures that the same imputation strategy is applied consistently.

4. **Output**:
   - The transformed data (`X_train` and `X_test`) will have missing values replaced with the computed statistics.

---

### **Example Output**
If the original `X_train` had missing values in the `Age` and `Fare` columns:
```
Age   Fare
22    7.25
NaN   8.05
38    NaN
```

After transformation:
```
Age   Fare
22    7.25
28.75 8.05
38    32.61759689
```

### **When to Use This Approach**
- Use this approach when:
  - You want to handle missing values differently for different columns.
  - You want to use robust statistics (e.g., median) for skewed data.
  - You want to ensure consistency between training and test data.

This approach is widely used in machine learning pipelines to preprocess data effectively.
