```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop(columns=['SalePrice']), df['SalePrice'], test_size=0.2)

# Creating an imputer object with a constant strategy to replace missing values with 'Missing'
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value='Missing')

# Fitting the imputer on the training set and transforming both train and test sets correctly
X_train = imputer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = imputer.transform(X_test)  # Corrected this line

# Displaying the constant values used for imputation
print(imputer.statistics_)  # Should show an array of 'Missing' values if there were NaNs
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Splitting the dataset:**
    
    - `train_test_split()` separates features and target variables, keeping 20% of the data for testing.
2. **Handling Missing Values with a Constant Value:**
    
    - `SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value='Missing')` replaces all missing values with `'Missing'` instead of using the most frequent value.
3. **Fitting and Transforming:**
    
    - `fit_transform(X_train)`: Learns the missing value replacement from `X_train` and applies it.
    - **Incorrect in Original Code:** `X_test = imputer.transform(X_train)` (you were applying transformation to `X_train` again).
    - **Fixed:** `X_test = imputer.transform(X_test)` ensures the learned imputation is applied correctly to test data.
4. **Displaying Imputation Values:**
    
    - `imputer.statistics_` returns an array showing that all missing values are replaced with `"Missing"`.

## Frequent Value Imputation

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop(columns=['SalePrice']), df['SalePrice'], test_size=0.2)

# Creating an imputer object with the most frequent strategy
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')

# Fitting the imputer on the training set and transforming both train and test sets correctly
X_train = imputer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = imputer.transform(X_test)  # Corrected this line

# Displaying the most frequent values used for imputation
print(imputer.statistics_)  # Correct way to print imputation values
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Splitting the dataset:**
    
    - `train_test_split()` splits the dataset into `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`, where `SalePrice` is the target variable.
    - `test_size=0.2` means 20% of the data goes into testing.
2. **Handling Missing Values:**
    
    - `SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')` replaces missing values with the most frequently occurring value in each column.
3. **Fitting and Transforming:**
    
    - `fit_transform(X_train)`: Learns the most frequent values from `X_train` and applies them.
    - `transform(X_test)`: Uses the learned values to fill missing values in `X_test` (this was incorrectly done with `X_train` in the original code).
4. **Displaying Imputation Values:**
    
    - `imputer.statistics_` shows which values were used for missing data replacement.
