### Introduction

Random Sample Imputation is a technique used to handle missing data in a dataset by replacing missing values with random values drawn from the observed distribution of the variable. This method helps to maintain the original distribution while preventing bias introduced by other imputation techniques.


### Why Use Random Sample Imputation?

- Preserves the original distribution of the variable.
- Prevents data loss due to deletion of missing values.
- Useful when the missing data is Missing At Random (MAR).
- Helps maintain variance in datasets.

### Steps for Random Sample Imputation

1. Identify missing values in the dataset.
2. Extract non-missing values from the column with missing data.
3. Randomly sample from the non-missing values.
4. Replace the missing values with these randomly selected values.

### Implementation in Python

#### 1. Import Required Libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

#### 2. Load the Dataset

```python
df = pd.read_csv('train.csv', usecols=['Age', 'Fare', 'Survived'])
```

#### 3. Identify Missing Values

```python
print(df.isnull().sum())  # Check for missing values
```

#### 4. Apply Random Sample Imputation

```python
def random_sample_imputation(df, variable):
    random_sample = df[variable].dropna().sample(df[variable].isnull().sum(), random_state=0, replace=True)
    random_sample.index = df[df[variable].isnull()].index  # Assign to missing values' indexes
    df.loc[df[variable].isnull(), variable] = random_sample
```

```python
random_sample_imputation(df, 'Age')
```

#### 5. Verify Imputation

```python
print(df.isnull().sum())  # Check if missing values are filled
```

### Advantages of Random Sample Imputation

- Maintains data distribution.
- Prevents deletion of valuable data.
- Easy to implement.

### Disadvantages

- Can increase variability in small datasets.
- Does not consider relationships between features.

### Conclusion

Random Sample Imputation is a simple yet effective method for handling missing data, especially when data is Missing At Random (MAR). However, it should be used cautiously in cases where feature relationships are critical.
