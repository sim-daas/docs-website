### **Outlier Removal Using Z-Score **

The **Z-Score** method is a statistical technique used to identify and remove outliers in a dataset. It is particularly effective when the data is **normally distributed**. The Z-Score measures how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean. Data points with a Z-Score greater than a threshold (typically 3 or -3) are considered outliers.

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Z-Score Formula**
$$Z= \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$$

##### Where:

- x  = Individual data point
- μ  = Mean 
- σ = Standard deviation
 

2. **Threshold**:
   - A common threshold is \( |Z| > 3 \). This means any data point more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean is considered an outlier.

3. **When to Use**:
   - The Z-Score method works best for **normally distributed data**. For skewed distributions, other methods like the **IQR (Interquartile Range)** are more appropriate.

---

### **Steps to Remove Outliers Using Z-Score**
1. Calculate the mean μ and standard deviation σ of the data.
2. Compute the Z-Score for each data point.
3. Identify outliers using the threshold \( |Z| > 3 \).
4. Remove or handle the outliers.

### **Code Example: Outlier Removal Using Z-Score**

#### **1. Import Libraries**
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import zscore
```

#### **2. Create Sample Data**
```python
# Example dataset
data = np.array([10, 12, 12, 13, 12, 14, 13, 15, 100])
print("Original Data:", data)
```

#### **3. Calculate Z-Scores**
```python
# Calculate Z-Scores
z_scores = zscore(data)
print("Z-Scores:", z_scores)
```

#### **4. Identify Outliers**
```python
# Define threshold (commonly 3)
threshold = 3

# Find outliers
outliers = data[np.abs(z_scores) > threshold]
print("Outliers:", outliers)
```

#### **5. Remove Outliers**
```python
# Remove outliers
data_cleaned = data[np.abs(z_scores) <= threshold]
print("Data after removing outliers:", data_cleaned)
```

### **Output**
```
Original Data: [ 10  12  12  13  12  14  13  15 100]
Z-Scores: [-0.61452315 -0.49161852 -0.49161852 -0.36871389 -0.49161852 -0.24580926
 -0.36871389 -0.12290463  3.19462689]
Outliers: [100]
Data after removing outliers: [10 12 12 13 12 14 13 15]
```

---

### **Explanation**
1. **Original Data**: Contains an outlier (100).
2. **Z-Scores**: The Z-Score for the outlier (100) is 3.19, which is greater than the threshold of 3.
3. **Outliers**: The value `100` is identified as an outlier.
4. **Cleaned Data**: After removing the outlier, the dataset no longer contains extreme values.

---

### **When to Use Z-Score for Outlier Removal**
- The data is **normally distributed**.
- You want a statistically robust method to identify extreme values.
- You are working with a small to medium-sized dataset.

---

### **Limitations of Z-Score**
1. **Sensitive to Non-Normal Data**:
   - Z-Score assumes normality. For skewed distributions, it may incorrectly identify valid data points as outliers.
2. **Impact of Outliers on Mean and Standard Deviation**:
   - If the dataset already contains outliers, the mean and standard deviation will be skewed, affecting the Z-Score calculation.

---

### **Alternative Methods for Outlier Removal**
1. **IQR (Interquartile Range)**:
   - Suitable for skewed distributions.
   - Uses quartiles to identify outliers.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Use box plots or scatter plots to visually identify outliers.
3. **Robust Scaling**:
   - Use median and IQR instead of mean and standard deviation.

### **Full Code**
```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import zscore

# Example dataset
data = np.array([10, 12, 12, 13, 12, 14, 13, 15, 100])
print("Original Data:", data)

# Calculate Z-Scores
z_scores = zscore(data)
print("Z-Scores:", z_scores)

# Define threshold (commonly 3)
threshold = 3

# Find outliers
outliers = data[np.abs(z_scores) > threshold]
print("Outliers:", outliers)

# Remove outliers
data_cleaned = data[np.abs(z_scores) <= threshold]
print("Data after removing outliers:", data_cleaned)
```

### **Conclusion**
- The Z-Score method is a simple and effective way to remove outliers from normally distributed data.
- Always check the distribution of your data before using Z-Score.
- For non-normal data, consider using the **IQR method** or other robust techniques.
