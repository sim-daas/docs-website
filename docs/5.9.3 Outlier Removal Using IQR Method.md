The **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method is a robust technique for identifying and removing outliers in a dataset. Unlike the Z-Score method, the IQR method does not assume a normal distribution, making it suitable for **skewed data**. It uses quartiles to determine the range within which most of the data lies, and any data point outside this range is considered an outlier.

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Quartiles**:
   - **Q1 (25th percentile)**: The value below which 25% of the data falls.
   - **Q3 (75th percentile)**: The value below which 75% of the data falls.
2. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**:
   $$IQR=Q3âˆ’Q1$$
   - Represents the middle 50% of the data.
3. **Outlier Thresholds**:
   - Lower Bound: \( Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR \)
   - Upper Bound: \( Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR \)
   - Any data point below the lower bound or above the upper bound is considered an outlier.

---

### **Steps to Remove Outliers Using IQR**
1. Calculate **Q1** and **Q3**.
2. Compute the **IQR**.
3. Determine the **lower and upper bounds**.
4. Identify and remove outliers.

### **Code Example: Outlier Removal Using IQR**

#### **1. Import Libraries**
```python
import numpy as np
```

#### **2. Create Sample Data**
```python
# Example dataset
data = np.array([10, 12, 12, 13, 12, 14, 13, 15, 100])
print("Original Data:", data)
```

#### **3. Calculate Q1, Q3, and IQR**
```python
# Calculate Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
Q1 = np.percentile(data, 25)
Q3 = np.percentile(data, 75)

# Calculate IQR
IQR = Q3 - Q1
print(f"Q1: {Q1}, Q3: {Q3}, IQR: {IQR}")
```

#### **4. Determine Outlier Thresholds**
```python
# Define lower and upper bounds
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
print(f"Lower Bound: {lower_bound}, Upper Bound: {upper_bound}")
```

#### **5. Identify Outliers**
```python
# Find outliers
outliers = data[(data < lower_bound) | (data > upper_bound)]
print("Outliers:", outliers)
```

#### **6. Remove Outliers**
```python
# Remove outliers
data_cleaned = data[(data >= lower_bound) & (data <= upper_bound)]
print("Data after removing outliers:", data_cleaned)
```

### **Output**
```
Original Data: [ 10  12  12  13  12  14  13  15 100]
Q1: 12.0, Q3: 14.0, IQR: 2.0
Lower Bound: 9.0, Upper Bound: 17.0
Outliers: [100]
Data after removing outliers: [10 12 12 13 12 14 13 15]
```

---

### **Explanation**
1. **Original Data**: Contains an outlier (100).
2. **Quartiles and IQR**:
   - Q1 = 12.0 (25th percentile).
   - Q3 = 14.0 (75th percentile).
   - IQR = 2.0.
3. **Outlier Thresholds**:
   - Lower Bound = 9.0.
   - Upper Bound = 17.0.
4. **Outliers**: The value `100` is identified as an outlier because it is greater than the upper bound.
5. **Cleaned Data**: After removing the outlier, the dataset no longer contains extreme values.

### **When to Use IQR for Outlier Removal**
- The data is **skewed** or **not normally distributed**.
- You want a robust method that is less sensitive to extreme values.
- You are working with a dataset where the distribution is unknown or complex.

---

### **Advantages of IQR Method**
1. **Robust to Skewness**:
   - Unlike Z-Score, the IQR method does not assume normality.
2. **Less Sensitive to Outliers**:
   - Quartiles are less affected by extreme values compared to the mean and standard deviation.

---

### **Limitations of IQR Method**
1. **Fixed Threshold**:
   - The 1.5 multiplier is a rule of thumb and may not be suitable for all datasets.
2. **Not Suitable for Small Datasets**:
   - For very small datasets, the IQR method may not work well.

---

### **Alternative Methods for Outlier Removal**
1. **Z-Score**:
   - Suitable for normally distributed data.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Use box plots or scatter plots to visually identify outliers.
3. **Domain Knowledge**:
   - Use expert knowledge to determine valid ranges for data.

### **Full Code**
```python
import numpy as np

# Example dataset
data = np.array([10, 12, 12, 13, 12, 14, 13, 15, 100])
print("Original Data:", data)

# Calculate Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)
Q1 = np.percentile(data, 25)
Q3 = np.percentile(data, 75)

# Calculate IQR
IQR = Q3 - Q1
print(f"Q1: {Q1}, Q3: {Q3}, IQR: {IQR}")

# Define lower and upper bounds
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
print(f"Lower Bound: {lower_bound}, Upper Bound: {upper_bound}")

# Find outliers
outliers = data[(data < lower_bound) | (data > upper_bound)]
print("Outliers:", outliers)

# Remove outliers
data_cleaned = data[(data >= lower_bound) & (data <= upper_bound)]
print("Data after removing outliers:", data_cleaned)
```

### **Conclusion**
- The **IQR method** is a robust and effective way to remove outliers, especially for skewed or non-normal data.
- It uses quartiles to identify extreme values and is less sensitive to outliers compared to the Z-Score method.
- Always visualize your data and consider domain knowledge when deciding on outlier removal techniques.
