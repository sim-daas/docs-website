## **What Are Percentiles?**

A **percentile** is a measure that indicates the value **below which a given percentage of observations** in a dataset falls.

- **25th Percentile (Q1)** → 25% of the data falls below this value.
- **50th Percentile (Median)** → 50% of the data falls below this value.
- **75th Percentile (Q3)** → 75% of the data falls below this value.

## **Outlier Detection Using Percentiles**

Outliers can be detected using **upper and lower percentile thresholds** instead of standard deviation or IQR.

### **General Approach**

1. Define a threshold range (e.g., **1st percentile and 99th percentile**).
2. Consider any values **below the 1st percentile** or **above the 99th percentile** as outliers.

Lower Bound=P1\text{Lower Bound} = P1 Upper Bound=P99\text{Upper Bound} = P99

## **Python Code for Outlier Detection Using Percentiles**

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample dataset
data = [10, 12, 15, 18, 19, 22, 24, 30, 35, 100, 105, 110]  # 100, 105, 110 are likely outliers

# Define percentile thresholds (e.g., 1st and 99th percentile)
lower_percentile = np.percentile(data, 1)  # 1st percentile
upper_percentile = np.percentile(data, 99)  # 99th percentile

# Identify outliers
outliers = [x for x in data if x < lower_percentile or x > upper_percentile]

print("Lower Bound (1st Percentile):", lower_percentile)
print("Upper Bound (99th Percentile):", upper_percentile)
print("Outliers:", outliers)
```

## **Advantages of Using Percentiles for Outlier Detection**

✔ **Robust to Skewed Data** – Unlike Z-score, it does not assume a normal distribution.  
✔ **Simple & Effective** – No need to compute standard deviation or IQR.  
✔ **Customizable Thresholds** – You can set the percentile cutoffs based on domain knowledge.

## **Summary Table**

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|**Percentiles**|Divides data into 100 equal parts|
|**Lower Bound**|1st percentile (P1)|
|**Upper Bound**|99th percentile (P99)|
|**Outlier Definition**|Any value outside **P1 and P99** is an outlier|
