### **1. Overview**

Simple Linear Regression models the relationship between a **dependent variable (Y)** and a **single independent variable (X)** using a linear equation:
$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
$$

-  Y : Dependent variable (target).  
- X : Independent variable (feature).  
- beta_0 : Intercept (value of \( Y \) when \( X = 0 \)).  
- beta_1 : Slope (change in \( Y \) for a unit change in \( X \)).  
- epsilon : Error term (accounts for variability not explained by \( X \)).

### **2. Objective**

The goal is to find the best-fitting line by estimating β0\beta_0 and β1\beta_1 that minimizes the **sum of squared errors (SSE)**:

$$
\text{SSE} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2
$$

### **3. Estimating Parameters**

The parameters β0\beta_0 and β1\beta_1 are estimated using the **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** method.

#### **3.1. Slope (β1\beta_1)**
$$
\beta_1 = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\text{Var}(X)} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2}
$$

### **Intercept (beta_0)**
$$
\beta_0 = \bar{Y} - \beta_1 \bar{X}
$$

### **4. Assumptions**

1. **Linearity**: The relationship between XX and YY is linear.
2. **Independence**: Errors are independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: Errors have constant variance.
4. **Normality**: Errors are normally distributed (for inference).

### **5. Goodness of Fit**

The **coefficient of determination (R2R^2)** measures how well the regression line fits the data:

### **6. Example**

Given the following data:

|XX|YY|
|---|---|
|1|2|
|2|4|
|3|5|
|4|4|
|5|6|

### **7. Key Takeaways**

- Simple Linear Regression models a linear relationship between XX and YY.
- The **OLS method** minimizes the sum of squared errors to estimate β0\beta_0 and β1\beta_1.
- R2R^2 measures the proportion of variance in YY explained by XX.
