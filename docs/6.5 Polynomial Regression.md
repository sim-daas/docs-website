# Polynomial Regression

## Overview

Polynomial Regression is a form of **regression analysis** in which the relationship between the independent variable xx and the dependent variable yy is modeled as an **n-th degree polynomial**. It is a special case of **multiple linear regression** where the features are transformed into polynomial terms.

### Key Points

- Polynomial Regression is used when the relationship between variables is **non-linear**.
- It extends linear regression by adding **polynomial terms** to the equation.
- It can fit more complex data patterns but is prone to **overfitting** if the degree of the polynomial is too high.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Linear Regression vs. Polynomial Regression

$$
\textbf{Linear Regression}: y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon
$$

$$
\textbf{Polynomial Regression}: y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + \dots + \beta_n x^n + \epsilon
$$

## Steps to Perform Polynomial Regression

1. **Data Collection**: Gather the dataset with independent (xx) and dependent (yy) variables.
2. **Feature Transformation**: Transform the independent variable xx into polynomial features.
3. **Model Training**: Use a regression algorithm (e.g., Ordinary Least Squares) to fit the polynomial equation to the data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics like **R-squared**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, or **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Advantages of Polynomial Regression

1. **Flexibility**: Can model non-linear relationships.
2. **Simple Implementation**: Easy to implement using libraries like `scikit-learn` or `NumPy`.
3. **Interpretability**: Coefficients provide insights into the relationship between variables.

## Disadvantages of Polynomial Regression

1. **Overfitting**: High-degree polynomials can fit the training data too closely, leading to poor generalization.
2. **Sensitivity to Outliers**: Polynomial models can be heavily influenced by outliers.
3. **Computational Complexity**: Higher-degree polynomials require more computational resources.

## Practical Considerations

### Choosing the Degree of the Polynomial

- Use **cross-validation** or **grid search** to find the optimal degree.
- Start with a low degree (e.g., 2 or 3) and increase gradually.

### Regularization

- Apply **Ridge Regression** or **Lasso Regression** to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.

## Example in Python

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Sample data
X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(-1, 1)
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# Transform features to polynomial
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)

# Fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_poly, y)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_poly)

# Evaluation
mse = mean_squared_error(y, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

# Plotting
plt.scatter(X, y, color='blue', label='Data Points')
plt.plot(X, y_pred, color='red', label='Polynomial Fit')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
